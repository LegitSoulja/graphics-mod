Components for the Spinethetic.com graphics mod

The files
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderREDUX.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderSPINETHETIC.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderVISUALSV.zip

are 3 different sets of timecycles, one or the other to be used at a time, and can only be used by a GTA V trainer capable of loading .ASI mods. Some GTA V trainers load ASI mods better than others. I take no repsponsibility as to wheter or not whatever particular one you may be using may be inferior in doing so.

The file
  - 2.3 to 2.4 update.oiv
  
is an OpenIV install package for those who have already installed version 2.3 of my graphics mod to quickly update it to version 2.4.
