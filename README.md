Components for the Spinethetic.com graphics mod

The files
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderREDUX.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderSPINETHETIC.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderVISUALSV.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderQUANTV.zip

are 3 different sets of timecycles, one or the other to be used at a time, and can only be used by a GTA V trainer capable of loading .ASI mods. Some GTA V trainers load ASI mods better than others. I take no responsibility as to wheter or not whatever particular trainer you may be using may be inferior in doing so.

The contained "VSReloader.asi" file enherient in each set, is made by UnknownModder, which can be fetched and LIKED here: https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/visualsettings-dat-reloader

The file
  - 2.3 to 2.4 update.oiv
  
is an OpenIV install package for those who have already installed version 2.3 of my graphics mod to quickly update it to version 2.4.

The file
  - Xenos64 injector + pre-loaded config.zip
  
Is a copy of the Xenos library injector, prepackaged with an injection config for use with the graphics retexture mod.
