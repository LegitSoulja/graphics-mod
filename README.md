Components for the Spinethetic.com graphics mod

The files
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderREDUX.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderSPINETHETIC.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderVISUALSV.zip

are 3 different sets of timecycles, one or the other to be used at a time, and can only be used by a GTA V trainer capable of loading .ASI mods. Some GTA V trainers load ASI mods better than others. I take no repsponsibility as to wheter or not whatever particular one you may be using may be inferior in doing so.
