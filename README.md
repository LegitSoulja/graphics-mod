Components for the Spinethetic.com graphics mod

**The files**
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderREDUX.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderNVR.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderVISUALSV.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderQUANTV.zip

are 3 different sets of timecycles, one or the other to be used at a time, and can only be used by a GTA V trainer capable of loading .ASI mods. Some GTA V trainers load ASI mods better than others. I take no responsibility as to wheter or not whatever particular trainer you may be using may be inferior in doing so.

**The file**
  - 2.3 to 2.4 update.oiv
  
is an OpenIV install package for those who have already installed version 2.3 of my graphics mod to quickly update it to version 2.4.

**The file**
  - Xenos64 injector + pre-loaded config.zip
  
Is a copy of the Xenos library injector, prepackaged with an injection config for use with the graphics retexture mod.

  Redux timecycles/visualsettings: JRomito - https://gta5redux.com/


Note about Redux, it should be known that Jromito has been caught stealing other people's work on 2 occasions to make his mods, however, a lot of people like Redux's timecycles/visualsettings files. Here is one of the articles in regards to Redux being stolen, you make your own decision: https://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-redux-mod-maker-accused-of-stealing-other-modders-work/
